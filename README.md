Soul Prey Github Pages
========

This repo includes GDD documentation that is suitable for offline viewing. You can download this Repository and view it like a web page.

All Documentation in this site must pass through the **Wiki Approval Process**, where ideas and design concepts are pitch, discussed, analysed and iterated before a final "locked down" decision is made and put forward into the final GDD.

The aim for the Github Pages documentation is to provide a stable and accessible way of viewing plans for the game. Any new team members are reccomended to read through this site first to get a better idea of the Game.
