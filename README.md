Git Notes
---------

Make sure that the folder contianing your clone of the project has the .gitignore included (this will automatically be added if you clone this project directly)
Do not include binaries (executables) with your commits. These should be ignored automatically anyway by the .gitignore

Unity Notes
-----------

Before you start making changes...

(Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor) and make sure Version Control is set to "Meta Files"

This will make Unity log changes in a manner that's more understandable Git (Git likes text files, not binary)

Branching Model
---------------

The Git workflow draws from the much loved model defined by [***Vincent Driessen***](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/):
